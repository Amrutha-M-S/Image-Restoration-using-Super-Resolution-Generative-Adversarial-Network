# Image-Restoration-using-Super-Resolution-Generative-Adversarial-Network
It can be challenging to extract valuable information from photographs taken with low-resolution cameras or images that have been deteriorated by noise, blur, or other factors. The ability of conventional image restoration methods to return photos to their original quality is constrained. Thus, there is a need for more sophisticated methods that can improve the quality of restored photos. The goal of this project is to create an image restoration model that can improve low-resolution or degraded photos utilizing post-processing methods along with SRGAN. The project's objective is to build the SRGAN model followed by post-processing methods for image restoration. This project will also investigate how various characteristics, like the size of the training dataset, the number of layers in the network, and the post-processing methods employed, affect the performance of the model.
